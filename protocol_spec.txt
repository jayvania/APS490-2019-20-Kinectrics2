protocol specification:
- request-response model with the client initiating the request
- all communication is done using JSON
- all strings sent over the bluetooth layer end in \n (newline character)

client -> server
	- the client sends a JSON object that specifies the request and any parameters for the request
	- there are three possible requests:
		- DUMP
			- This causes the server to send all the data that it has
		- QUERY
			- This causes the server to execute a query, returning all data more recent than the date provided
			- The date is provided in three more fields (year, month, day) in the JSON
		- END
			- This causes the server to disconnect
	
	Examples of client requests in JSON:

	//this causes the server to send all data that it has 
	{ 
		"request": "DUMP"
	}

	//this causes the server to send all data from October 21st, 2019 and onwards
	{ 
		"request": "QUERY",
		"year": 2019,
		"month": 10,
		"day": 21,
	}

	//this causes the server to close the connection
	{ 
		"request": "END"
	}

server -> client
	- the server sends a JSON object that specifies a response status and any data accompanying the response
	- there are three possible responses:
		- ERROR
			- The request the client sent is malformed or otherwise not understood
			- The server will supply the reason for the error, if possible
		- DATA
			- This indicates the server has executed a query and data accompanies the response
		- EXIT
			- Acknowledgement of ending the connection (response to an END request)
	
	Examples of server responses in JSON:
	
	//this indicates the server did not understand the client's request
	{
		"response": "ERROR",
		"error": "CRASHANDBURN is not a valid request"
	}
	
	//this is a response to a DUMP or QUERY request, with data sent in an array
	{
		"response": "DATA",
		"data" : [ 
			([2019, 11, 30, 17, 38], 3.7), 
			([2019, 12, 01, 17, 37], 4.2), 
			([2019, 12, 02, 17, 36], 1.6), 			
			]
	}
	
	//this indicates the server has received the END request and is closing the connection
	{
		"response": "EXIT"
	}
